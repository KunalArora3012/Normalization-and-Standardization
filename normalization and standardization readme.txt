When working with data, it's often necessary to normalize or standardize the values to make them more comparable or to make certain algorithms work more effectively.


Normalization


Normalization is the process of scaling individual samples to have unit norm. This can be useful if you have features with different scales and you want to ensure that they contribute equally to the analysis.


One common approach to normalization is to use the L2 norm, which is also known as the Euclidean norm. This involves dividing each sample by the square root of the sum of the squares of its values.



from sklearn.preprocessing import normalize


X_normalized = normalize(X, norm='l2')
Another option is to use the L1 norm, which involves dividing each sample by the sum of its absolute values.



from sklearn.preprocessing import normalize

X_normalized = normalize(X, norm='l1')


Standardization


Standardization is the process of transforming data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This can be useful if you have features with different units or scales and you want to ensure that they are all on a comparable scale.

One common approach to standardization is to use the z-score, which involves subtracting the mean from each value and dividing by the standard deviation.


from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler


scaler = StandardScaler()
X_standardized = scaler.fit_transform(X)
Conclusion



Normalization and standardization are important techniques for working with data. By scaling the values appropriately, you can ensure that your analysis is more accurate and effective. The choice of normalization or standardization method will depend on the specific requirements of your analysis and the characteristics of your data.
